The Temperature Converter App is a simple and user-friendly tool that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Upon launching the app, users are presented with a choice between two conversion options: "Celsius to Fahrenheit" or "Fahrenheit to Celsius." Once a conversion direction is selected, users can input a temperature value, and the app instantly displays the equivalent temperature in the other unit. The app is designed to be intuitive, providing a seamless experience for quickly converting temperatures in either direction.
